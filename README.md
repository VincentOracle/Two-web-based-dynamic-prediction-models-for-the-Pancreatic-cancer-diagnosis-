# Introduction
## Overview of Pancreatic Cancer with Distant Metastasis
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. A significant contributor to this dismal outlook is the high incidence of distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Distant metastasis occurs when cancer cells spread from the primary tumor in the pancreas to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lungs, or peritoneum. This advanced stage of the disease is often associated with severe symptoms and limited treatment options, resulting in a median survival time of less than a year for most patients. Understanding the factors that contribute to distant metastasis is crucial for early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.
## Objectives of the Study
This study aims to develop predictive and prognostic tools for pancreatic cancer with distant metastasis. The primary objectives are to:
i.Identify the variables associated with the development of distant metastases using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
ii.Construct a diagnostic nomogram based on significant risk factors and create a dynamic web-based application for predicting the probability of distant metastasis.
iii.Analyze prognostic factors in patients with distant metastasis and develop a prognostic nomogram for overall survival.
iv.Evaluate the efficiency of the nomograms using ROC Curve, C-Index, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA).
## Description of the Dataset and Variables Used (Data and Methods)
The dataset used in this study, "Pancreatic_cancer_with_distant_metastasis.csv," was obtained from the SEER database and contains data on 591 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The dataset includes 14 variables: patient demographics (age, sex, race), clinical features (tumor size, grade, stage), treatment modalities (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy), and survival outcomes. Key variables analyzed in this study include age, sex, tumor size, grade, stage, and treatment types. 
Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and applying necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis. This comprehensive dataset enables a thorough examination of factors influencing distant metastasis and overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients(Liu et al, 2023).
